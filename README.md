# Multi-headed-Attention-on-Generative-Adversarial-Nets

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are machine learning models for generating images, texts, sounds, etc. Training a GAN is a resource-intensive task. In this project, we explore the possibility of adding a multi-head attention layer to GAN. Unfortunately, we were not able to generate nice clear images, but we hope that researchers with access to higher processing power will be more successful with our approach.
